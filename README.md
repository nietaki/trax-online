# Trax Online

This will hopefully will turn into a Phoenix app that allows you to play 
[Trax](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/748/trax) online with a friend.

To bootstrap the project run `bootstrap.sh`. It will take care of some messy
node/npm/brunch/elm setup.

To run the umbrella project in dev mode run `mix phx.server`

## Project goals

- get warmed up with Elixir after the holiday season ;)
- play around with umbrella apps
- learn Elm basics
- create a MVP for playing Trex online
- get Trex out my head ;)

## Non goals (eye on the prize)

- good web UI (layout, look & feel)
- any authentication whatsoever
